#### This application allows a user to input two words and tells the user whether those words are an anagram or antigram

#### By David McCaslin

## Description

This application allows users to enter two words or phrases and receive information on if those words are anagrams. The application will determine if the words are anagrams - containing the same set of letters but in a different order - or if they are antigrams - containing none of the same letters. The application will also filter for non-words, such as words that do not contain a vowel.
